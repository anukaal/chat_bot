# **Chat Bot** ðŸ¤–

* The most natural definition of a chatbot is â€“ a developed a program that can have a discussion/conversation with a human. For example, any user could ask the bot an inquiry or a statement, and the bot will respond or perform an activity as appropriate.
A chatbot interacts on a format similar to instant messaging. By artificially replicating the patterns of human interactions in machine learning allows computers to learn by themselves without programming natural language processing.

* While a bot is a computerâ€™s ability to understand human speech or text short for chat robot. A chatbot is merely a computer program that fundamentally simulates human conversations. It allows a form of interaction between a human and a machine the communication, which happens via messages or voice command.


* A chatbot is programmed to work independently from a human operator. It can answer questions formulated to it in natural language and respond like a real person. It provides responses based on a combination of predefined scripts and machine learning applications.

* When it is asked a question, the chatbot will respond based on the knowledge database available to it at that point in time. If the conversation introduces a concept it is not programmed to understand, it will either deflect the conversation or potentially pass the communication to a human operator. Either way, it will also learn from that interaction as well as from future interactions. Thus, the chatbot will gradually grow in scope and gain relevance.
