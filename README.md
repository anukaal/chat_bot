# **Chat Bot** ðŸ¤–

* The most natural definition of a chatbot is â€“ a developed a program that can have a discussion/conversation with a human. For example, any user could ask the bot an inquiry or a statement, and the bot will respond or perform an activity as appropriate.
A chatbot interacts on a format similar to instant messaging. By artificially replicating the patterns of human interactions in machine learning allows computers to learn by themselves without programming natural language processing.

* While a bot is a computerâ€™s ability to understand human speech or text short for chat robot. A chatbot is merely a computer program that fundamentally simulates human conversations. It allows a form of interaction between a human and a machine the communication, which happens via messages or voice command.


* A chatbot is programmed to work independently from a human operator. It can answer questions formulated to it in natural language and respond like a real person. It provides responses based on a combination of predefined scripts and machine learning applications.

* When it is asked a question, the chatbot will respond based on the knowledge database available to it at that point in time. If the conversation introduces a concept it is not programmed to understand, it will either deflect the conversation or potentially pass the communication to a human operator. Either way, it will also learn from that interaction as well as from future interactions. Thus, the chatbot will gradually grow in scope and gain relevance.


## Know About ChatterBot 

* ChatterBot is a Python library that makes it easy to generate automated responses to a userâ€™s input. ChatterBot uses a selection of machine learning algorithms to produce different types of responses. This makes it easy for developers to create chat bots and automate conversations with users.

## An example of typical input would be something like this:

```
user: Good morning 
bot:  How are you ?
user: You're welcome.
bot:  What is your name ?

```


## Language Independence

The language independent design of ChatterBot allows it to be trained to speak any language. Additionally, the machine-learning nature of ChatterBot allows an agent instance to improve itâ€™s own knowledge of possible responses as it interacts with humans and other sources of informative data.
